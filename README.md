# Sample React Blog

This is a sample blog I used to get started with ReactJS. To view the end result visit https://cristytarantino.github.io/ReactBlog.

It shows how to simply use the state, how to fork with forms and really basics ReactJS features.

N.B. The project is full of comments for my personal learning experience.


# Getting started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To get started simply run `yarn install` or `npm install`.

Once the installation process is done just run `yarn start` or `npm start`.
